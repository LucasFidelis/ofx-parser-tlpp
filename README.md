    ofxParser := OFXParser():New(cOFXContent)
    cXML := ofxParser:ToXML()
    CopyToClipboard(cXML)
Return .T.

Static Function ReadFile(cPath)
    Local oFile
    Local cFileContent := ''
    oFile := FWFileReader():New(cPath)
    If (oFile:Open())
        While (oFile:hasLine())
            cFileContent += oFile:GetLine()
